                            <h4>5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h4>

                            <p>In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</p>

                            <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).

                            <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>


                            <h4>6. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h4>

                                We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age.

                            <h4>7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h4>
                            <p>In Short:  You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</p>

                            <p>Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section 'HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?' below.</p>

                            <p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>


                            <h4>Account Information</h4>
                            <p>If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Log in to your account settings and update your user account.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Cookies and similar technologies: Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default.

                            <h4>8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h4>

                            <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>

                            <h4>9. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</h4>

                            <p>In Short: Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.</p>

                            <p>We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated 'Revised' date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification.
